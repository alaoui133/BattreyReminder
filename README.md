This program is a battery reminder application that checks the status of the battery in a computer system at regular intervals and displays a reminder message when the battery level falls below 20% or reaches 100%.

The application is developed using the C# programming language and the .NET Framework. It utilizes the System.Management namespace to access system information, specifically the PowerStatus class, to retrieve the current battery charge status and battery life percentage.

The application has a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Windows Forms, which displays the current battery life percentage and two buttons. The "Run" button triggers an immediate check of the battery status, while the "Stop" button stops the timer and closes the application.

The application also uses a timer to periodically check the battery status and display the reminder messages. When the battery is fully charged, a message box is displayed reminding the user to unplug the charger. When the battery level falls below 20%, a warning message is displayed reminding the user to plug in the charger.

Overall, the program serves as a helpful reminder for users to monitor their battery status and take appropriate action to ensure their system remains powered on when needed.
